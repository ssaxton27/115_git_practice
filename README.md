Practice Repo for Data 115  
This space is dedicated to the Data 115 Final Project   
The Project covers the statiscal analysis of the top 50 NHL players during the 2022-2023 season.  
Specifically, the scoring tendencies by period of each of the top 50 players.  
Attached in the files section is the PDF version of the Project and all of the source data.

Project Overview:
The basis of this project was to explore if the National Hockey League’s (NHL) top 50 goal scorers during
the 2022-2023 regular season had a tendency to score more goals during one specific period versus other
periods. The data was collected from quanthockey.com and supplemental data from hockey-reference.com.
The source for goals per period required the data be extracted from each team’s box score for all 82 games.
Once the basic data was collected and organized, the players were ranked from 1 to 50 based on their total
goals scored for the season. Next, each players goals were categorized by the period it was scored. Then
the percentage of their per period goals was calculated against their total season goals. The percentage was
rounded to 1 tenth to simplify the data set. No outliers were removed from the data set because all values
were pertinent to the overall data. The data set includes overtime goals in the total goals for the season,
this will account for the small variation in the percentages of goals per period. Additionally the number of
games played was tracked but not used to adjust the percentages. Finally, the data set was summarized in
subset, Overall Statistics, First through Third Period Statistics and Final Findings.
